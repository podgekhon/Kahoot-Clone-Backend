1. When and where will we schedule meetings (e.g. 11am Wednesdays and 2pm Fridays: in-person at X location, on Teams video call, on Discord)?

2. Where will we record our meeting minutes (e.g. Teams documents, Gitlab Wiki, Gitlab markdown file)?

3. Where will we communicate (e.g. Teams channel, Discord, Messenger)?

4. What is a reasonable response time for messages/posts when communicating?

3. How will we handle conflicts (i.e. differing opinions)? Note: If conflicts cannot resolved this way, please contact your tutor.

4. List the steps a team member does if they get stuck (e.g. stuck debugging).

5. A day before the due date we notice a team member's work is very broken and incomplete. Instead of waiting until the due date, list the steps we will take to prevent this from occuring in the first place. Note: contact your tutor if this happens as well.
